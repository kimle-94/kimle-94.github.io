                victims escape abuse, harassment and violence of all kinds or

                is for everybody from youths to adults. Additionally, they
                suggested using <a class="primary">Headspace</a> and
                <a class="primary">Calm</a> as competitors since both are
                learning and meditation apps. As a result of conducting the
                competitive analysis research myself, here are three key

              As a designer who strives to make user experiences as good as
              possible, here are some
              <a class="primary">
                key takeaways I learned from this project: <br /><br
              /></a>
              <a class="primary"> Stakeholders could be valuable users.</a> They
              are also trying to find a solution to a problem they had
              previously experienced. So understanding their perspective and
              thoughts could help designers better understand what the pain
              points are. <br /><br />
              <a class="primary"
                >It is always worthy and valuable to listen to user feedback.</a
              >
              It could not be a final solution until we repeatedly tested it

              Even when the iLa team reached out to me with the basic
              wireframes, I still did the research phase not to steal ideas or
              designs, but rather to gain a deeper understanding of the product
              in order to design it more effectively.

                test the product with actual users who are unfamiliar with
                it.</a

              I handed over all of the necessary files with the product to the

              developer team to implement the app. As a result, I did
              <a class="primary">
                not have the opportunity to work directly with the developer
                team,</a
