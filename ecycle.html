              <p>
                ECYCLE is a Canadian e-bike sharing system company that provides
                electric bikes in many cities across Canada. The company
                provides multiple interconnected kiosks which allow users to
                rent or return e-bike based on their renting period. From now,
                users will not worry about returning e-bike late because the
                app's map will show nearby kiosks.

            <p>
              Users currently have to go to kiosks to check and rent available
              e-bikes, which is too inconvenient and time-consuming for them.
              Putting it in another context, a group of friends need three
              e-bikes; however, they do not know how many available e-bikes at
              the kiosks in advance, and each station is around 15 minutes walk
              apart.

              How night I design an app that allows people to rent e-bikes

              <h2>THE PROPOSED SOLUTION <br /><br /></h2>
              <p>
                eCycle is an app that allows e-bikers to find nearby kiosks
                displayed on a map and to check if any e-bikes are available
                without physically being at the kiosks. In addition, users can
                reserve e-bikes through the app as long as there are available
                bikes.

            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

              Before jumping directly into the user research, I started with a
              competitive analysis of other renting e-bike apps in the market,
              such as <b> PBSC, Lime, and Nextbike</b>, which would help me to
              identify the main market users, and determine what makes other
              competitors succeed. Here is the list of 5 questions that I used
              to find out more about them.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Who are the main movers on the market?</li>
              <li>What types of resources different players have?</li>
              <li>How they use their assets to stand out?</li>
              <li>Where are the gaps in competitorsâ€™ capabilities?</li>
              <li>Which resources you have (or need) to fill in those gaps?</li>

            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p class="secondary">
              When the prototype design is complete, the next step is to test
              the target user directly to validate the design solution to the
              problem that I wanted to solve. However, due to time constraints,
              I was unable to test the app with actual users. Therefore, the
              next ideal steps would be to test my designs as well as usability
              testing to reject unnecessary features and improve user
              experiences.

            <h2>Measure Success</h2>
            <p class="secondary">
              If I were to develop this and deploy it to the market, I would
              like to verify the practicability of the app by conducting further
              user interviews to measure the value of my solution. Furthermore,
              I will implement "Dark Mode" for the app since this helps users
              have a better experience when using the app at night.

            <p class="secondary">
              Since I worked on this solo project for academic purposes, I had
              to conduct research from the beginning stages of identifying the
              issue and determining the solution to the end stages of prototype
              development. As a result, it was sometimes challenging for me to
              define the solutions and determine what features the app should or
              should not have.
